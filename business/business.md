## Business goals
[^1]
### Primary Business Goals
#### BG-01: Increase Club Attendance
As a club operator, I need to increase club's attendance, because it will lead to higher revenues.

#### BG-02: Remove Stigma and Raise Awareness of Striptease
As a strip club operator, I need to remove the stigma associated with striptease, because it will lead to wider acceptance of our service and a larger number of customers.

#### BG-03: Expand Clientele and Flexible Working Hours
As a stripper, I need more clients and flexible working hours, as this will increase my income and improve my work-life balance.

#### BG-04: Client Verification
As a stripper, I need a way to verify the reliability and trustworthiness of clients, because providing certain services (e.g., private performances) to unreliable individuals could pose a danger to me without the club's protection (e.g., risk of client aggression, breaking agreed-upon rules).

#### BG-05: Booking a Stripper
As a client, I need a discreet and convenient way to select and book a stripper, because this saves me time and maintains privacy.

## Justification of the Economic Feasibility of the Project
### Costs & benefits
[Online spreadsheet with calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pfv0A_9-FDrhvn3mnXLFHf2NRknKj2LlisVipGCFNmk/edit?gid=164423424#gid=164423424)

### Unit costs
Unit cost/cost per customer seems redundant in the context of our application as the price does not depend on the number of users unless the unexpectedly high volume requires more computation power. The only exception is the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), which determines how much money we spend for attracting 1 customer through marketing.
