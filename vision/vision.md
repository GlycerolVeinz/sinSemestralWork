## Business Goals

- **As an artist**, I need a platform that ensures I get paid on time and have a clear breakdown of my earnings because currently, payment delays cause financial instability.
- **As an event organizer**, I need to manage concert schedules, ticket sales, and payments all in one app because juggling multiple systems increases the risk of errors and delays.
- **As a venue manager**, I need to streamline event bookings and ensure revenue from ticket sales because manual booking processes waste time and lead to scheduling conflicts.
- **As an event participant**, I need a platform where I can easily search for upcoming concerts and free-time activities based on my preferences because it helps me find events that match my interests and schedule.

## Business Events

- Participant searched for an event based on location, date, and genre preferences.
- Participant purchased a ticket using the integrated payment system.
- Organizer created a new event with details such as date, time, venue, and ticket pricing.
- Artist accepted a concert booking from an event organizer.
- Participant received notifications about changes to event details (e.g., time change or venue update).
- Artist received payment after the event concluded.
- Venue confirmed the booking for the concert via the app.

## Finance

- **Initial development**: $50,000–$100,000 for MVP (developer hours, design, testing).
- **Ongoing maintenance**: $20,000/year (updates, server costs, customer support).
- **Marketing expenses**: $10,000/year (attract users and venues).

### Five-Year Estimate:

- **Realistic**: Total $400,000 over 5 years (steady growth with consistent users).
- **Optimistic**: Total $600,000 over 5 years (fast adoption, fewer issues).

### Revenue:
- **Subscription Model**: Organizers and venues pay a monthly fee ($100/month).
- **Transaction Fees**: 2% of ticket sales and artist payments.
- **Advertising Revenue**: Sponsored events and ads for local services.

### Five-Year Revenue Estimate:
- **Pessimistic**: $500,000 (limited user base, low ad revenue).

- **Optimistic**: $3M (rapid growth, large user base).

## Risks

### Fraud or Illegal Activity
- **Description**: Fraudulent organizers or individuals may create fake or illegal events, sell tickets, and disappear with the money, leaving participants with no event to attend and tarnishing the platform’s reputation.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement a thorough verification process for event organizers (e.g., ID verification, business credentials).
  - Use user reviews and ratings for event organizers to provide transparency.
  - Integrate fraud detection algorithms to flag suspicious behavior (e.g., rapid ticket sales for unknown organizers).

### Refunds for Canceled or Fraudulent Events
- **Description**: If events are canceled, especially due to fraud or unforeseen circumstances (e.g., weather, artist no-shows), managing refunds can become complicated, leading to financial losses and frustrated participants.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create a clear refund policy that outlines conditions for refunds and ensures transparency.
  - Implement an automated refund system where ticket payments are processed back to participants within a specified time frame if an event is canceled.
  - Use an escrow system for payments: release funds to organizers only after the event occurs.
  - Offer partial refund options if part of the event goes ahead (e.g., performer canceling but the rest of the event continues).

### Competition from Established Platforms
- **Description**: Competing with well-established concert management or ticketing platforms like Eventbrite or Ticketmaster could make user acquisition challenging.
- **Mitigation**: Focus on niche features such as transparent payments and personalized event recommendations to differentiate from competitors.
